## Problem solving
The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing it.

## High-level language
A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

## Low-level language
A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to run; also called “machine language” or “assembly language”.

## Portability
A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

## Interpreter
A program that reads another program and executes it.

## Prompt
Characters displayed by the interpreter to indicate that it is ready to take input from the user.

## Program
A set of instructions that specifies a computation.

## Print statement
An instruction that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on the screen.

## Operator
A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

## Value
One of the basic units of data, like a number or string, that a program manipulates.

## Type
A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).

## Integer
A type that represents whole numbers.

## Floating-point
A type that represents numbers with fractional parts.

## String
A type that represents sequences of characters.

## Natural language
Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

## Formal language
Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.

## Token
One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.

## Syntax
The rules that govern the structure of a program.

## Parse
To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

## Bug
An error in a program.

## Debugging
The process of finding and correcting bugs.
