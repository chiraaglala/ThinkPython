(1) In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

(2) If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?

(3) You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

(4) In math notation, leading zeros are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?

(5) What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?


Open the terminal or command line interface and start the python interpreter as follows:
